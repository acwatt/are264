Helpful tips from Reed about doing research

Research starts with:
- start with a question that is interesting to you
- you will probably work on it for 6+ years
- research is easy, you just need to know more than anyone else in the field about that specific thing

Sources of ideas:
- classes, seminars, not th literature, newspaper, non-econ nonfiction (biography, history), talking to people (economists and noneconomists)
- first find an idea that's interesting, then learn all you can about it
- write down all your ideas within minutes
- make a headers of a topic or idea, then start filling it in with papes, experiences, related stuff so you can start to catelog things together for later review

If you think you have a good idea:
- do due diligence: examine the data and code thoroughly and get the core of the project really tight
- then go straight to the hardest question you can imagine from a referee and try to test your results agains that

Idea evaluation:
- what is the question, why is it interesting?
- why is the existing literature crappy, nonexisitant, unresolved?
- how are you going to sovle it?


Main challenges to social cost of pollution research:
1. Causal inference
2. Pollutants and emissions are correlated
3. Short-run vs long-run exposure
4. Adaptation and heterogeneity in dose-response function
5. Monetization (hospitalization costs /= welfare, that my welfare loss might be a lot more than just the hopitalization cost of the injury to me)


READ for NAAQS nonattainment status effects (Reed's slides):
- henderson, list et al
- greenstone 2002
- greenstone, list, syverson
- walker 2012
- Hanna 2010


NAAQS research:
- could think more about how to idenify firms, areas that are non-attainment, but have heterogeous impacts from being non-attainment
- look at papers exaimining impacts of NAFTA on economy and how it relates to env police

Tools
===================================================
Unconditional Quantile regression (Fipo et al 2009, but should find a better user manual for UQR that's easier to understand)



===================================================
CAA Research:
===================================================
1. understanding the costs of CAA:
	we worry that we might eventually reach a point where deminishing returns of abatement put marginal costs of abatement above marginal benefits. In a static model, we probably wouldn't trade off $20 more dollars of abatement for a $10 improvement. But in a dynamic model, that $20 might also incentivize innovation that could decrease the cost of abatement in the future or increase profitablity of firms with low product emissions

2. Sh=chlenker and Walker 2015 CA airports using EPA and CARB monitors -- could update using PA data to point out issues with sparse nature of EPA monitors





===================================================
Climate Damages Research:
===================================================

- take lessons from lit in dev and health where they look at adoption rates and barriers to adotpion of a specific tech that could mitigate climate change. "why do poeple not invest in seemingly positive NPV investments"

- energy efficiency gap:

See recent work by:
Heckman, Tobias, & Vytlacil 2001, Angrist 2004, Angrist & Fernandez-Val 2010,
Bertanha & Imbens 2014, Allcott 2015, Dehejia, Pop-Eleches and Samii 2015,
Gechter 2015, Athey & Imbens 2016

For the most part, these econometric problems have not received a lot of
attention in the energy/environment space



===================================================
IO Policy evaluation
===================================================
Idea from IO handbook chapeter on costs of regulation:
- compare firms/markets before/after and in/out of attainment areas to estimate cost of non-attainment status / regulation on firms and markets. Compare to estimated benefits of attainment there (health with population, etc)
