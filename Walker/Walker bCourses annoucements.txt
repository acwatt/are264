We are going to wrap up our discussion of climate change impacts after the break and begin talking about other methods used in valuation ranging from revealed preference approaches to stated preference approaches. 

I am pasting a list of papers we are going to touch on below - please look at the starred papers in more detail. 

Lastly, I posted Problem Set 1 on bCourses. The first half of the problem set pertains to material we have already covered. The second half of the problem set addresses material we will cover next week. 

Have a great spring break.

Class reading for Thursday piggybacks on the previous announcement, starting with Black (1999) which we have already discussed. 

Here is a link (Links to an external site.) to a helpful discussion on discount rates and the social cost of carbon














Hi Folks - we are going to wrap up our discussion of non-market valuation on Tuesday of next week. This will include a brief discussion of stated preference methods. We will then start discussing benefit-cost analysis / program evaluation with more of a focus on the regulatory cost side of the equation. Please take a look at the following papers for next week (which we will cover on both Tuesday and Thursday). Starred** being the papers we will spend the most time on...
