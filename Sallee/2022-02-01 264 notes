## Writing a paper
Hierarchy of exposure:
- many people read your title (from your CV or TOC
- less abstract
- less intro
- epsilon read the paper

## Abstract
- motivate topic
- explicate tresearch questions
- explain the results
- anticipate objections/concerns *
- state contribution relative to literature
- outline paper

## Strategic Citations
- directing citaitons: helping the editor find the appropriate referees
- Flattering citations: citing the referees or editor of the journal
	- this can be hard to balance -- if you really don't want someone to be a referee, do you cite them just in case they referee it, or do you avoid citing them to decrease the chance the editor will use them as a referee, but risk them being a referee anyway and being upset that you didn't cite them at all...
- Seminal citations: what makes a paper seem important -- connecting it to the roots of the topic
- Current citations: is this a current topic of interest? Should be some recent research on it, right?
- Tier of citaitons: are your citiatons published in the same tier of journal that you are submitting to? The editor may take the tier of your citiations as a signal for what type of journal is 

Need to know a paper well enough that your comments on the paper are accurate.
