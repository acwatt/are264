# Suppose that you knew that there were thousands of underground storage tanks in the  United States. Mostly they contain petroleum products (because they are largely tanks  under gas stations). A substantial fraction of them leak at some point after a decade or  two. The leaks might be harmful to health, but they would have impacts at a very local  level, like within a quarter of a mile of the site (possibly through groundwater  contamination, but that may not be the only thing).

# Suppose now that you were able to obtain a record of all the leaks that happened in a  particular state. The data on leaks includes the start and end of any leak, as reported to the  local environmental regulator.  

# Think through, in some detail, how you might try to construct a paper around this topic.  What other data might you try to obtain? What regression would you try to run? How  would you frame the paper?




# My Notes

## Required Corrective Actions
"Immediate responses may include removing flammable or explosive materials from the release area and preventing discharges to stormwater utilities, wetlands, and surface waters. It may also be necessary to provide bottled water for individuals, families, or businesses that rely on groundwater for drinking, bathing, and food preparation. The intrusion of petroleum vapors into indoor building spaces has become an important concern and may require the active ventilation of indoor building spaces." [1]

## Health outcomes
"can contaminate surrounding soil, groundwater, or surface waters, or affect indoor air spaces" [1]



## Possible areas to explore
- avoid notification of authorities
- avoiding preventing leaks
- avoiding cleaning up leaks
    - what are the incentives? Look into the fines associated with leaks
    - "Documentation and reporting requirements are also unique to each state and tribe" [1]
- causal health impacts
- information shocks to housing prices: after a leak is made public
- LUST trust fund -- how are the funds used? Who pays into the funds
- [Underground Storage Tanks (USTs) Program in Indian Country](https://www.epa.gov/ust/underground-storage-tanks-usts-program-indian-country) 
    - how are USTs regulated in Tribal lands? Are they less regulated, if so why? Is it because the gov't does not want to interfere with the political process inside the tribal land, or is it because there is less of a policical incentive? Is there any way to tell these two apart?
    - How do the clean up times vary with inside or outside tribal lands?


I have only conducted a cursory literature search, but there seems to a lack of research on environmental impacts on tribal lands. The EPA regulates many regulated USTs on tribal land [3]. I






# Abstract
*(less than 100 words). Assume some results for purposes of writing a mock abstract. (Strongly recommend that you write the abstract AFTER doing the other parts.)*




# Data
*a discussion of what data you would try to gather*

Underground Storage Tanks (USTs) can contain many different products, including nuclear waste.[1] However, since only petroleum and hazerdous materials are federally regulated in USTs, I will narrow the scope of this proposal to petroleum leaks from USTs.

I would like to get the following data for all households within a 2-mile radius of, and for 1 month before and after, each leak:

- drinking water quality, ideally for each households from before, during, and after the leak. I doubt this data exists at the household level.
- drinking water source (separated into ground water sourced at the house vs pumped in using pipes from a municipal source). I would want to drop any 
- Compile the dates and details of state and federal regulatory changes regarding USTs




# Analysis
*a plan of what econometric methods you would deploy*


Possible econometric analyses:
- Diff in Diff of health outcomes: between inside and outside quarter-mile radius, before and after leak
- Triple Differences:  between inside and outside quarter-mile radius, before and after leak, drinking water source from ground water vs from munipal piped source. (footnote: After writing this up, I stumbled upon this paper [1], so I want to acknowledge that someone has done a similar analysis, but that none of what I have written was taken from this paper. I am specifically waiting until after submitting this assignment to read the paper.)

Since the "greatest potential threat from a leaking UST is contamination of groundwater"[2], it makese sense to confine this analysis to drinking water quality and associated health outcomes.







# Framing
*this will be embodied in the abstract, but describe briefly here how you might think of framing/positioning the paper*
