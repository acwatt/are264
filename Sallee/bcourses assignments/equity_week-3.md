There are several channels through which (a) pollution or (b) policies that mitigate pollution can have a welfare impact on individuals. If we want to describe the distributional impacts of pollution (or policies that try to reduce it), we need to have some sense of these different channels and their relative importance. Think about how you would construct a taxonomy of these channels and come up with a list. Record that list here. (Ideally you will do this before completing the relevant reading. To give away that game, the Fullerton article provides one such taxonomy, which we will discuss.)
