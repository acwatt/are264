# Goals of the course


# Plan of the course
1. Twelve lectures covering cononical topics on efficiency and equity of environmental policy

2. Two non-standard class sessions:
    - One research workshop (writing and idea development)
    - One modeling workshop

3. Your work
    - Daily bullet points on reading or prompt
    - Two problem sets combining standard math problems and
    “build your own” math problems
    - Two research skills assignments


**Before each lecture I start with a recap of last lecture.**

# Prep for lecture 2:
- Before next class, upload your “instrument choice” exercise on bCourses
- Starred reading is Goulder and Parry review article on instrument choice; lots of other articles



# Outline for today
1. What is an externality, and how does it cause market
failure?
    - An externality affects costs or utility directly, not through prices

2. How do we fix problems caused by externalities?
    - The Pigouvian prescription is to set a tax equal to marginal damages at the optimum, which will restore market efficiency

3. Are Pigouvian taxes efficient?
    - Transitions are not Pareto improvements, but outcomes under a Pigouvian tax are Pareto efficient if the tax is at the right level. But it is hard to get the right tax, so the primary appeal of market based instruments is that they require far less information to achieve cost effectiveness than do other interventions.


# Today's key questions:
## What is an externality?
- Karthik: Burdens of the impacts are not occuring through a price system
- Sebastian: A cost carried by someone who is not causing the cost
- Trevor: Cost/impact that occurs to someone who is not part of a transaction.

Jim: If two people make a transaction of a house and drive of the local housing prices, is the higher price faced by a new person entering the 

- Lucy: when things move through prices, we can still get a 

> The externality is in some ways a straightforward concept: yet, in others, it is extraordinarily elusive. We know how to take it into account in our analysis, and we are aware of its many implications, but, despite a number of illuminating attempts to define the notion, one is left with the feeling that we still have not captured all of its ramifications. [Baumol and Oates (p. 14)]

Are these externalities?
- Beekeeper and orchard 
- Neighborhood gentrification (*not if it's through the housing price*)
- Carbon emissions
- I join Facebook
- I buy the only copy of a Wu Tang album
- I buy the first N solar panels

> An externality is said to exist when the production or consumption of a good has a direct impact (i.e., not through prices) on consumption or production sets of another agent; that is, it alters their production or utility function.

- We are most interested in externalities as they rationalize policy intervention

- The existence of an uncorrected externality violates conditions of the First Welfare Theorem

- Market outcomes will not be Pareto efficient—there is a way to reorganize economic activity so as to make everyone better off

## What's a Pigouvian Tax?
- Simon: putting a price on something 
- August: a tax that realigns the incentives so that the private incentives match that of the social planner

> The Pigouvian prescription is to set a tax equal to marginal damages at the optimum, which will restore market efficiency

### Example: Smoking
#### What's the pigouvian tax on smoking?
- Sebastian: want to charge smokers some $ when they smoke in public to disuade them from smoking in public.

Jim: would like to charge smokers a fine based on # of people and types of people that are aroudn them when they smoke. But in reality, we can feasibly only put restrictions in place and charge sales tax.




## Is a Pigouvian tax efficient? What do we mean by that exactly?

- Do we get a Pareto improvement from moving from the status quo to a Pigouvian tax? No, the smokers are worse off.

- Kaldor-Hicks improvement (eliminated some DWL in the world).

> Transitions are not Pareto improvements, but outcomes under a Pigouvian tax are Pareto efficient if the tax is at the right level. But it is hard to get the right tax, so the primary appeal of market based instruments is that they require far less information to achieve cost effectiveness than do other interventions.



# The Pigouvian Prescription
> Pigou’s solution to the problems caused by an externality is to set a tax per unit of a good, with the tax set equal to the marginal externality *at the optimal resource allocation*

> - A.C. Pigou (1912) posed a solution: “internalize the externality”
    
> - This will restore conditions of First Welfare Economics and restore Pareto efficiency

>- Importantly, this does not involve policy intervention in any other market

>- I recommend that you think of this policy prescription as a
default—it is a null hypothesis that you accept unless
presented with compelling evidence

>- We will discuss various cases where the Pigouvian Prescription needs to be modified, but I believe it is a useful starting place


## Illustration
- Representative consumer with utility function $U(X_1, X_2 )$
- $X_1$ is clean good
- $X_2$ is dirty good
- Externality linear in total dirty good consumption $\phi X_2$
- Exogenous income $Y$ to be spent
- Producer prices fixed
- Planner can place taxes on $X_1 and $X_2$ ; remitted by consumer
- Consumer faces prices $P_j = t_j + p_j$ , where $p_j$ is producer price
- Recycle revenue in lump sum transfer $T$
- Assume consumer “small”; does not recognize contribution to total dirty good consumption

### The Planner's Problem

$\max\limits_{X_1,X_2} SWF = U(X_1, X_2) - \phi X_2$
s.t. $p\cdot X \leq Y$

### How do we find the solution (Planner chooses quanties)
$\mathcal{L}_P = U(X_1, X_2) - \phi X_2 +\lambda(Y-p\cdot X)$

FOC:

$\frac{\mathcal{L}_P}{X_1}$

$\frac{\mathcal{L}_P}{X_2}$

### The Consumer's Problem

### How do we find solution?


## How do we the consumer's FOCs to match the planner's FOC?
(If consumer’s problem has same solution conditions as planner’s, then consumer will choose first best allocation)

- Set $t_1=0$ and $t_2 = \frac{\phi}{\mu}$.
- Then, $\mathcal{L}_C = U(X_1, X_2) - \phi X_2 +\lambda(Y-p\cdot X)$
- Consumer’s problem now same as planner’s (note $\mu = \lambda$, remember $\mu$ is a function, so we need $\mu$ at optimal allocation)
- FOCs will collapse to planner’s
- First-best allocation is achievable (tax can achieve same
outcome as planner who chooses quantities directly)
- There is no tax on the clean good


## Observation 1: Willingness to pay
- $\phi$ is the externality in utils, need to translate to dollars using $\mu$ or $\lambda$ for consumers or goverment.


## Observation 2: Where are the elasticities?
- depends on first best vs real world...


## Observation 3: At the optimum...
- the "optimum" is where **all** choices are made efficiently. 
- Suppose the population of an area depends on air quality and marginal damages of air pollution depends on population. The Pigouvian tax on emissions is marginal damages assuming the population is at the optimal size.
- Adaptation and defensive investments also must be at the optimum. If optimal defensive expenditures are much less than the observed, then
