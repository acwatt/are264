First, I just want to affirm that I think you are well on your way to being a great environmental economist. I’m hoping that pressure to review material for the field exam will help accelerate that.

For my part of the exam, I think you ended up not completing much of it, so it was hard to give you an endorsement to pass. I’m sure it will be different this go around.

On my part of the exam, I am very much looking for high level intuition about the policy logic of correcting externalities, and hoping that you can cite back to me some of the key highlights/lessons learned from the course.

So, on this year’s exam, I asked a question about fugitive methane emissions. The big picture here is that we are stuck in a second-best policy world with the current technology, but we could move to a better situation if the improved measurement were available. The question tries to walk you through thinking about how to value the measurement.

The first part asks about the current information context. I’m looking for you to invoke the main tools of the course. Here, we have a pollutant that is uniform in damages, but we are taxing the unit of output.

First and foremost, this is not efficient if producers can do something other than reduce output (i.e., they have some abatement actions available).

Second, the emissions per unit of output presumably vary, so you would be in a Diamond-style model (damages per unit of the taxed good vary), but the prior point is even more fundamental.

To figure out the second-best tax, you’d need the damages per unit, and the own derivatives to invoke Diamond. A really special case in which this policy is first-best is if the only way to abate is to reduce production and there is no heterogeneity (and you know the quantity of emissions per unit).

Some people wrote down notation or modeling for this part, but it wasn’t necessary.

The second part asks about if you had the new data. This would be “fully efficient” in some sense, as in we can directly tax emissions now. But, the prompt involves a lot of uncertainty, so I would have been happy if people had said (and I think 1 or 2 did) that it isn’t truly “fully” efficient because we will get the tax level wrong (Weitzman could be invoked here).

I was looking also for a recognition that, even in this setting, we are still truly in a second-best world because of general equilibrium issues. So, you could have invoked Goulder, Hafstead and Williams here, or just cited the issues of tax-interaction effects.

Again, I wasn’t really looking for notation.

On the last part, I just wanted people to write down a problem that made sense and demonstrate their comfort in jotting down some notation. I was pretty open with what people did here, as long as I could follow the logic.

Let me know if you’d like to meet or discuss anything further. I’m around until the exam.
